# Snake Game üêç

## Introduction
Welcome to the Snake Game repository! This classic Snake game implementation in Java is the perfect demonstration of my programming skills and passion for game development. The game is built using Java and provides an engaging experience for players of all ages.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer.
- Increasing difficulty: The game gets progressively harder as the snake grows longer.
- Score tracking: Keep track of your high scores to challenge yourself and your friends.
- Smooth controls: Intuitive keyboard controls make it easy to play.

2. Compile the Java files using `javac SnakeGame.java`.

4. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
5. Eat the food (represented by red circles) to grow longer.
